# EssentialStock AI

EssentialStock AI is a Snowflake-native application built to help hospitals, NGOs, and public distribution systems monitor inventory health and prevent stock-outs of essential goods.

## Problem
Inventory data is often fragmented across systems, causing late detection of shortages or overstock. This leads to empty shelves, delayed treatment, and wastage.

## Solution
The solution provides:
- A unified inventory health dashboard
- Heatmap view by location and item
- Early stock-out alerts
- AI-based reorder quantity suggestions
- Exportable action plan for procurement teams

## Tech Stack
- Snowflake (SQL, Dynamic Tables)
- Streams & Tasks
- Streamlit (inside Snowflake)
- Python (basic logic)

## Prototype
The working prototype is implemented as a Snowflake Streamlit App.
Due to Snowflake security restrictions, public anonymous access is not supported.

## Impact
Helps ensure timely availability of essential medicines and food supplies while reducing waste and improving operational efficiency.
